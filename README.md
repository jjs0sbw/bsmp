## Home of the Basic Structural Modeling Project

>The Basic Structural Modeling Project (BSMP) addressing the structural modeling activities developed by John N. Warfield and extended by Joseph Simpson and Mary Simpson.  The project is discussed, analyzed and developed in the context of three high level documents.  These high level documents are:

>1. Problem Definition Report (BSMP_PDR.pdf)
>2. Conceptual Solution Report (BSMP_CSR.pdf, BSMP_CSR_A.pdf)
>3. Detailed Design Report

#### Problem Definition Report

>The BSMP Problem Definition Report provides a definition of the issues, concepts, tools and procedures used when structural modeling techniques are engaged to develop solutions to complex problems. 

#### Conceptual Solution Report

>The BSMP Conceptual Solution Report provides example concepts, tools, and procedures used to create solutions to structural modeling problems. This report examines solutions from the perspective of the selection of model types, the representation of the contextual structural relationship, and the techniques used to reflect applicable, appropriate mathematics. 

#### Detailed Design Report

>The BSMP Detailed Design Report provides an example design solution for the 19 cities problem.  This document is organized around the elements of an abstract relation type that contains the prose, graphics and mathematics necessary to clearly communicate the solution approach and context.
