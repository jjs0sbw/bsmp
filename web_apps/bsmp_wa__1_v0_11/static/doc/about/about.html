     <h2>Basic Structural Modeling Web Application 1</h2>
	 <p>Basic structural modeling is a component of structural modeling.<br>  
	 This web application is designed to support the testing and improvement of <br>
	 structural modeling techniques and methods.  Structural modeling is used to create <br>
	 a system structure from a disorganized and unordered set of objects.  To properly <br>
	 test the structuring methods and techniques, a system with known order is selected <br>
	 and scrambled into a ramdom system state.  This ramdom, unstructured system is then <br>
	 structured using the methods and techniques associated with structural modeling. When<br>
	 the ordering process is complete, the final output from the process is checked against<br>
	 The known system structure.
	 This web application supports structural modeling by organizing and presenting a web<br>
	 based interface to a  strict subordination matrix.  This strict subordination matrix <br>
	 is used to order 19 cities which have a natural language structuring relationship.<br>  
	 This natural language structuring relationship is "north-of."  Only one city is <br>
	 allowed at each level.<br></p>
	 <p>
	 This section will be improved as the application is further developed.
