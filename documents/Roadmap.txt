Project Development and Transition Roadmap

The Basic Structural Modeling Project (BSMP) is the first part of a larger effort.

The BSMP focuses on the foundational mathematics and application of the mathematics to 
specific types of structural modeling problems.  The Sage math workbooks, project reports
and the first web application comprise the BSMP artifacts.

The Structural Modeling Project (SMP) will be the next project after the BSMP and will focus on
the application of the methods and techniques developed in the BSMP phase.  The SMP will
produce a set of web based software applications, each of which focuses on a specific type 
of structural modeling structure.  The general application development list is:

1 - Strict-subordination ordering (only one element at each level) (BSMP)
2 - General-subordination ordering (one or more elements at each level) (SMP)
3 - Central-uniform clustering (cluster objects around the matrix diagonal - 
all connection weights the same) (SMP)
4 - Lower-triangular clustering (cluster objects in the lower triangular region of the 
matrix - all connection weights the same) (SMP)
5 - Upper-triangular clustering (cluster objects in the upper triangular region of the 
matrix - all connection weight  the same) (SMP)

After this set of applications are complete, the Structural Integration Modeling 
Project (SIMP) will start.  The SIMP will focus on creating a programatic framework that
integrates, supports and expands the all of the structural modeling elements developed to 
date as well as the development of more advanced structural modeling elements.
